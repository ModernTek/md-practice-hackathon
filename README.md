> By @cbracco and @ModernTek

This repository contains our attempt at Project #1 of the [MD Practice Hackathon](https://study.moderndeveloper.com/new-updates/october_2016/practice-hackathon-details/). We have chosen the following four UI elements to create:

- [Collapsible  (Accordion)](http://materializecss.com/collapsible.html)
- [Modal ](http://materializecss.com/modals.html)
- [Static Popover (with Dismiss)  ](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#dismiss-on-next-click)
- [Wave ](http://materializecss.com/waves.html)
